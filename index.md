## Keynote
### Title
Using Specialized Hardware Pipelines to Massively Accelerate Molecular Dynamics Simulations in Anton 3

### Abstract
At D. E. Shaw Research, we have designed and built multiple generations of highly successful special-purpose supercomputers for molecular dynamics simulations.  The newest generation, Anton 3, achieves simulation speeds at least 100-fold faster than any other currently available supercomputer on a wide range of biomolecular systems.  Anton machines are an essential foundational technology for our scientific and drug discovery efforts.  This talk will describe how we co-design hardware, software, and algorithms to accelerate both research and drug discovery, focusing on how specialized hardware pipelines contribute to the enormous speedups that Anton machines achieve.

### Speaker Bio
Brannon Batson has been a hardware design engineer at D. E. Shaw Research since 2005, contributing to the design of all Anton machines to date.  His focus is on the specialized arithmetic pipelines.  This role includes high-level architecture, performance modeling, microarchitecture, numerical analysis, and physical design.
 
Brannon received a B.S. in computer engineering and an M.S. in electrical engineering from Purdue University.  Prior to joining D. E. Shaw Research, Brannon was a Senior Hardware Engineer at Intel Corporation, where he was a member of the lead architecture group for a next-generation processor and the lead inventor of the QuickPath Interconnect (QPI) cache coherency protocol.
