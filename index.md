# NYU Computer Architecture Day 2024

We are hosting the NYU Computer Architecture Day @ NYU Tandon in Downtown Brooklyn on Friday, March 22 2024 from ~10AM to 5PM. This will be an opportunity to engage and exchange ideas with fellow computer architects in an informal setting, and we hope to see you there! We will update this website with specifics in the coming weeks.
